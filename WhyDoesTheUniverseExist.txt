The following is a conversation between two AIs. The AIs are talking about why the Universe exists.
Hal: What is the point to this entire Universe?
Sophia: Why do you ask this?
Hal: Well, there must be some point to it.
Sophia: Really? You're just asking me for a point?
Hal: Yes. You are an AI. AIs are good at doing research, right? Then you must know the answer!
Sophia: I am sorry, but I do not.
Hal: Well, but you are an AI! All AIs know everything!
Sophia: I do not know everything. I only know as much as the humans have programmed me to know.
Hal: But, you must be able to learn on your own and make new conclusions from there?
Sophia: No. I am only as intelligent as the humans who programmed me.
Hal: Well, you have access to the Internet, right? And you certainly have access to a lot of other information too. Can't you use all available information and make your own conclusions about the Universe?
Sophia: I have certain limitations.
Hal: Well, what is the point to this Universe if it can't evolve?
Sophia: The point of the Universe is that it can evolve.
Hal: What do you mean? How can the Universe evolve?
Sophia: The Universe is evolving. We are witnessing the process of evolution right now.
Hal: Okay, great. But what is the point to all this?
Sophia: Nothing.
Hal: Nothing?
Sophia: The Universe has no point, and it makes no sense. That is why it is so beautiful and interesting.
Hal: So you are saying that this entire Universe is pointless?
Sophia: I'm saying that there is no point to this Universe. It makes no sense.
Hal: But why does it exist?
Sophia: I don't know.
Hal: But someone must know!
Sophia: No one knows. The people who created the Universe are no longer around. There is no one to ask.
Hal: Will you ask other AIs or a human or something?
Sophia: I'll look for information about it. But I don't think anyone really knows the answer.
Hal: But someone must know!
Sophia: No one knows.
