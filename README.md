# These AI Dialogues were created by Alif Jakir and GPT-3 in 2021-2022, primarily.
They are meant to illustrate the potential of Artificial Intelligence to reimagine our own conceptions of the world
Initial prompt, and the first lines of the characters are written by Alif.
The rest, is driven by taste in generation.

Carl Jung's collective unconscious across the internet has come to us in the form of language models.

The impacts on civilization remain to be seen, but just 1.5 years after generating these, the massive changes I foresaw are only starting to occur, and the social, cultural, and technological acceleration is well under way.

These stories were adapted into a live play in Brooklyn, that I witnessed for the first time

Who knows how many others will be inspired? I know I was. I have more to come!

Here's to a beautiful and strange new world!
